#set previous number
y=0
#use for loop and set the range
print("Fibonacci sequence")
for x in range(1,11):
#for 10 times, add the corresponding x one by one.
 y=y+x
 print(y)
#pay attention to this point.
#if there is no space in the command print(y),result will just be 45.
#account:this is about when there is a space, the command is in loop.Not vise versa.
